Simple RPG

This is a simple text based RPG built through the guidance of freeCodeCamp.

The main objective of this game is slay the dragon by first gaining experience, gold, and items through cave exploring.

It was built with base HTML/CSS/JavaScript, no frameworks of any kind.

This simple RPG is a good refresher for conditionals, if/else statements, DOM manipulation and CSS styling.

Thanks for looking!
